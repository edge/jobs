# Distributed Systems Engineer (Remote)

**Salary:** Competitive ‚Äì DOE  
**Location:** Remote  
**Type:** Full-time  

Edge is building the Supercloud. This decentralised platform replaces the traditional cloud with a global mesh of compute, storage, and delivery. It‚Äôs faster, greener, more secure, and radically more efficient.

We are seeking a Distributed Systems Engineer to build and scale the underlying architecture of our decentralised future. You‚Äôll craft RESTful APIs, tackle complex backend challenges, and prototype experimental systems. These systems span blockchain, distributed computing, and high-volume data flows.

If you're an engineer who dissects tough technical problems, iterates with precision, and can turn a raw concept into production-ready code, you'll fit right in.

## üîß Key Responsibilities

- Develop and maintain RESTful APIs and backend services using Node.js  
- Design and implement robust backend systems for blockchain, distributed computing, and fault-tolerant networking  
- Prototype experimental features like decentralised video streaming or AI-powered tools  
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define and deliver new features  
- Troubleshoot and debug complex backend issues with a focus on reliability and performance  
- Design and manage database schemas using ArangoDB  
- Explore and evaluate trends in Web3, blockchain, and AI/LLM technologies  
- Maintain clean, documented codebases using Git and GitHub

## üß™ Technical Task

As part of your application, complete the following task to demonstrate your backend and system design capabilities.

### ‚ú¥Ô∏è Objective

Build a **distributed message processing system** with:

1. A Node.js backend that implements a RESTful API  
2. A simple distributed worker system to process messages  
3. Appropriate data storage and job tracking

### üìå Requirements

**Core:**
- A RESTful API for submitting jobs/messages
- Distributed worker architecture to process jobs
- Fault tolerance (e.g. job reprocessing if a worker fails)
- Job status tracking
- Mock or minimal processing logic

**Technical:**
- Well-structured RESTful endpoints
- Horizontally scalable system design
- Use of appropriate data storage (in-memory is fine; persistence is a plus)
- Logging and error handling

### üß™ Sample Use Cases

Your system should be generic, but these examples may help:

- Distributed file processing (e.g. image resizing)
- Data enrichment pipelines
- Blockchain transaction verification simulation
- Distributed computation engine
- Bonus: Relate your design to Edge Network‚Äôs decentralised architecture

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

We‚Äôll review submissions based on:

- Architectural decisions
- Code quality and organisation
- Scalability and fault tolerance
- Documentation and reasoning
- Backend and distributed systems understanding
- Overall completeness

We also expect that you follow the guidelines outlined in our  
üìñ [Development Practices](https://github.com/edge/jobs/blob/master/development-practices.md)

## üì¨ Submission Instructions

Take the time you need. This is your chance to show what you can do.

1. Push your solution to a public GitHub repository  
2. Include a `README.md` with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Design and scaling considerations
   - Architecture explanation (bonus: diagrams)
   - (Optional) demo script or example usage

3. Email [jobs@edge.network](mailto:jobs@edge.network) with:
   - Subject: `Distributed Systems Engineer`
   - A link to your GitHub repo
