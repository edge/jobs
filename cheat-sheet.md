# Edge Submission Cheat Sheet

This is your unofficial guide to building a standout submission.

It’s not about perfection. It’s about signal. We want to see how you think, how you work, and how you care about your craft.

## 🚀 What We Love

These aren’t requirements. But they help us say yes faster.

### ✅ Demos (seriously)

- Link to a running app, even if it’s hosted on Glitch, Render, or localhost via video
- For non-UI projects, record a screen capture of the system running
- If it moves, show it. If it processes, prove it. We love **evidence**

### ✅ Clear Commit History

- Follow [Development Practices](./development-practices.md)
- Meaningful, atomic commits tell us how you think
- Bonus: we can read your Git log instead of asking you interview questions

### ✅ Docs That Tell a Story

- Explain what you built and why you built it that way
- Point out known limitations or tradeoffs
- Suggest what you’d do next with more time
- Bonus: diagrams, videos, flowcharts

### ✅ Good Readmes

We love `README.md` files that include:

- Setup instructions
- A short project overview
- Clear design decisions
- Future improvements
- Optional: demo video link or screenshots

### ✅ Questions

Got stuck? Curious about something? **Ask.**

- Join our Discord
- Message us during your project
- We don't dock points for asking — we respect curiosity

## 👀 What We Notice

### 🔍 Attention to Detail

- Clean formatting, consistent naming, sensible folder structure
- Reusable, modular code (not everything in one file)
- Dead code removed. No TODOs left uncommented

### 🎯 Focus

- Submissions that **do one thing well** are better than those that try to do everything
- If you scope things down for polish, tell us — we like that

### 🧠 Understanding

- If you used AI, great — just make sure you can explain it
- We will ask follow-up questions. Own your work

---

## 🙅‍♂️ What Doesn’t Help

- Single commit dump with no message
- Code that doesn’t run and no docs to help
- Submissions that clearly used AI without human oversight
- Projects without README or context

---

## 🧵 Summary

We’re not looking for flawless. We’re looking for **clear thinking**, **care**, and **a working slice of something interesting**.

**Help us understand what you did and why. That’s what matters.**
