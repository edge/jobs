# Work at Edge

Welcome to the Edge Network careers repository. This is where you'll find open roles and everything you need to know about working at Edge.

## About Edge

Edge is building the Supercloud. This decentralised platform replaces the traditional cloud with a global mesh of compute, storage, and delivery. It’s faster, greener, more secure, and radically more efficient.

Our infrastructure spans thousands of nodes across the world. It powers everything from decentralised VMs to high-performance CDN, DNS, and storage. The Supercloud is built for Web3, AI, and the next generation of internet services.

We’re not just improving infrastructure. We’re changing how it’s built and who it serves.

## Our Philosophy

> _“Work should fit around our lives, not the other way round.”_

We’ve reimagined how work works. There are no central offices. No unnecessary meetings. No outdated rituals. We operate with deep trust, flexible structure, and zero bureaucracy.

Communication is asynchronous. Responsibility is shared. Everyone has the space to focus and the freedom to work when they’re at their best.

We have core hours for team overlap. Outside of that, your time is yours.

We don't use Teams. We don't use Slack. We use tools that actually support modern work. Think Discord, GitHub, and clean internal documentation.

## What We Look For

We’re looking for people who:
- Solve complex problems with clarity and creativity
- Take pride in their craft and iterate with purpose
- Communicate clearly, especially in writing
- Are self-directed and dependable
- Care deeply about what they build

Whether you're deploying infrastructure, architecting distributed systems, or building experimental hardware, you’ll be working on the foundations of the Supercloud.

## Open Roles

All roles are fully remote and async-first. Job descriptions and technical tasks are available in the [`jobs/`](./jobs/) folder.

- [Distributed Systems Engineer](./jobs/distributed-systems-engineer.md)
- [Robotics Engineer](./jobs/robotics-engineer.md) (coming soon)

## The Hiring Process

We’ve simplified our approach. No cover letters. No CVs. No long-winded interviews. Here's how to apply:

1. **Read the Job Spec**  
   Open the role you're interested in under the [`jobs/`](./jobs/) folder. Each listing includes a technical task.

2. **Complete the Task**  
   Show us what you can do by completing the project. Take as much time as you like. Let your work speak for itself.

3. **Submit Your Work**  
   Email [jobs@edge.network](mailto:jobs@edge.network) with:
   - The job title as the subject line
   - A link to your GitHub repository containing the completed task

4. **We’ll Review and Respond**  
   If your project shows strong alignment, we’ll get in touch for a brief conversation. If there’s a fit, we’ll make an offer.

That’s it. No noise. Just signal.

## Perks

- Remote-first, async-friendly work culture
- Flexible hours around core availability
- No commute and no micromanagement
- Deep technical focus with high autonomy
- Colleagues who care and challenge you to improve
- A chance to shape the future of decentralised infrastructure
